A comprehensive analysis system for processing and analyzing financial service complaints using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze consumer complaints in the financial services sector, providing insights through data exploration, text preprocessing, and advanced analytics. The system processes complaint data, performs exploratory data analysis, and prepares the data for further machine learning tasks.

## Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Efficient loading and cleaning of complaint data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of complaint patterns and trends
- **Text Processing**: Advanced text cleaning and normalization
- **Modular Architecture**: Well-organized codebase with separate modules for different tasks
- **Reproducible Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization
